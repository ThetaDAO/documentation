Some Theta supporters still hold their ERC20 Theta tokens from years ago. These old Theta tokens were created on the Ethereum network and played an important role in the early days of Theta. However, as we transition to our independent Theta Mainnet Blockchain, these tokens are no longer compatible with our platform and cryptocurrency exchanges.

Users have started migrating Theta tokens from the old ERC20 standard to the new TNT20 tokens on the Theta Mainnet. All Theta holders can swap their old Ethereum Theta tokens for the new native tokens on the Theta Mainnet using the migration contract.

## How to Migrate Ethereum ERC20 THETA to Native Mainnet THETA TNT20 Tokens?
The migration smart contract allows you to migrate your legcy Theta tokens safely without connecting to any external platforms. It is a designated Ethereum contract created solely for migration purposes and is not controlled by anyone, including the Theta team. It is open-source, meaning the code is publicly available and can be reviewed by anyone.

In brief, after ERC20 THETA tokens are sent to the migration contract, these tokens will be burned and permanently removed from the Ethereum blockchain. Users performing the migration will receive new THETA native mainnet tokens in the TNT20 standard.

Using the migration contract requires users to pay the gas fee on the Ethereum Blockchain. This means that every user who wants to perform the migration needs to have ETH in their wallet. We recommend choosing the average (normal) gas fee when sending THETA tokens to the migration contract.

The migration can be done from any wallet you typically use to access THETA tokens. All wallets support the migration process.

To perform the migration, send your old THETA tokens to the migration smart contract address: `0x9b055FC2893fc79EEd0859623D9BABF731f66D27`.

For the amount, choose to send the entire balance of your THETA tokens. The migration contract will wait for the full balance to arrive before initiating the migration process. This is done to optimize for high Ethereum gas fees, which are partially covered by Theta Labs.

After the transaction is confirmed and broadcasted to the Blockchain, the migration process will start and your wallet will be credited with new native THETA tokens. Depending on the network usage, it may take 2â€“10 minutes to process the migration.

Your wallet will automatically recognize the new THETA tokens, which will be credited to your wallet. The new THETA tokens are tied to the same private key and seed where you hold your old ERC20 THETA tokens.

**Congratulations, you have successfully performed the migration. Now you can be sure you hold the latest THETA tokens in the TNT20 standard.**
